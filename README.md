Sample work of how to apply machine learning on vehicle sensor data to estimate engine's health and predict lifetime

Modern production equipment are usually equipped with sensors to enable users monitor their performance and condition. Here I present example of my work at a mining company that use few of our data to build a predictive maintenance framework specifically to estimate health level of an equipment and see its degradation curve and use it to predict lifetime.
