# predictive_maintenance
Sample work of how to apply machine learning on vehicle sensor data to estimate engine's health and predict lifetime

Modern production equipment are usually equipped with sensors to enable users monitor their performance and condition. Here I present example of my work at a mining company that use few of our data to build a predictive maintenance framework specifically to estimate health level of an equipment and see its degradation curve and use it to predict lifetime.

The idea is to use the before-known breakdown event and relate it with sensors data to then get an estimate of degradation curve to predict end of lifetime

See the interactive pythone notebook file (.ipynb) for the code. Other .py files are dependencies and resources for the algorithm
